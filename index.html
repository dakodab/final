                <h2>Terf Island</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Transphobia takes different forms all over the world, but British TERFism is a distinct cultural product. Ideologically, anti-trans bias in the U.K. works differently than it does in otherwise very similar countries.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the U.S., for example, anti-trans efforts tend to be associated with other generally reactionary goals, like limiting reproductive rights, healthcare access, and women’s rights more broadly. In contrast, in the U.K. (which has earned itself the nickname <span class="tooltip-inline">"TERF Island" <span uk-icon="icon: info; ratio: 0.6"></span>
                        <span class="tooltip-bubble">
                          <b>TERF Island:</b> <i>"The United Kingdom, viewed as a centre of gender-critical feminism, or more broadly of transantagonistic policies and attitudes”</i> - <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Citations:TERF_Island">Wiktionary</a> <br><br> The term seems to have emerged on then-Twitter around 2018, but the exact etymology is difficult to trace, as so much pro-trans rights content has been wiped from the platform since Musk’s takeover in 2022.
                        </span>
                      </span>), the anti-trans rights movement (which prefers to refer to itself as “gender critical”) has become even more mainstream by aligning itself with feminism – framing trans rights and women’s rights as not only separate issues, but inherently incompatible goals. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    By making trans people (especially trans women and girls) the enemy, the movement has very successfully mobilised cisgender British women as committed anti-trans activists. Trans rights, like legal recognition and protections, are posited as detrimental to cisgender women’s health, safety, and freedom.

            <p>
                Anti-trans rhetoric picks up fervour especially in the context of anything related to reproduction, babies, or families – areas of life that some British cis women feel belong exclusively to them. For example, the issue of whether or not trans parents should be allowed to seek support from breastfeeding support groups is a perennial debate in major British media outlets such as The Telegraph and The Times. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The U.K. is also the home of Mumsnet, a platform mothers use to share tips, guidance, and support, and which has also become the central digital platform through which the anti-trans rights movement recruits, organises, and builds power.

            <div class="uk-container uk-container-small">

                <p>
                    Although anti-trans rights activists in the U.S. have not achieved the same level of consistent media attention that they have in the U.K., they have achieved many similar policy goals. In fact, over the past few months, the U.S. and the U.K. have been almost in lock step in the rollback of trans legal rights. In January, President Donald Trump federally mandated a “biological and scientific” definition of womanhood in the U.S. via <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/">executive order</a>. In April, the U.K. Supreme Court <a href=" https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cvgq9ejql39t">did the same</a> via its ruling in the <i><a href="https://supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2024-0042">For Women Scotland v. The Scottish Ministers</a></i> case. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    That same month, the NHS-commissioned <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-u-k-s-cass-review-badly-fails-trans-children/">Cass Review</a> was released, criticising the provision of gender-affirming healthcare to minors in the U.K. and arguing that the existing evidence base is not strong enough to support these treatments. The report was immediately endorsed by the Conservative, Labour, and Green parties (although Green later withdrew its support). 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some of the Cass Review’s conclusions were fairly benign, like recommending that trans children need better access to mental health care – when I spoke with gender-specialist GP Dr Kamilla Kamaruddin, she also raised this point. Other conclusions seemed to fall within the plausible realm of policy reform – such as the recommendation that youth gender clinics be regionalised, rather than centralised. But the review also makes more extreme arguments – against minors having access to any form of gender-affirming medical intervention, and in some cases, against them being allowed to transition even non-medically.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite receiving widespread international criticism from both LGBTQIA+ rights activists and medical practitioners (<a href="https://www.bma.org.uk/bma-media-centre/bma-to-undertake-an-evaluation-of-the-cass-review-on-gender-identity-services-for-children-and-young-people">including the British Medical Association</a>), the review led to the total ban and subsequent criminalisation of puberty blockers in the U.K..
                </p>

                <p>
                    Three weeks later, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services followed suit with a 400-page report called <i>Treatment for Pediatric Gender Dysphoria: Review of Evidence and Best Practices</i>, which similarly suggests that transness is a “social contagion”, potentially caused by other mental health issues. It also calls for bans on gender-affirming care for minors, and goes even further by explicitly endorsing conversion therapy. 
                </p>

                <h2>Missing Persons</h2>

                <p>
                    One policy change that the U.K. has not yet followed the U.S. on is the way that surveys and other forms of public data collection gather information on gender - which particularly impacts trans parents. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In February, the U.S. modified all federal forms to only include the options “male”, “female”, or “missing data”.  It was part of researcher and evaluator Dr Audacity Nadler’s job to inform home visiting programmes, which support new parents and infants, that they needed to stop collecting any other data on gender. “There was just starting to be progress in delving into the fact that our community of transgender parents and caregivers, and transgender people giving birth, even exists,” says Nadler, who is also a former doula and a parent of three. “There was just a tiny inroad into having knowledge about that community at all. And now that's been cut off in so many ways and erased again. So it feels like the personal stories are all we have for information about our community's needs.”

                    Nadler explains that even counts of trans parents that have already been collected will instead have to be reported as “missing data” – erasing the evidence that those people exist at all. In a system that at least nominally prioritises “evidence-based” policies and programmes, data on the existence of a population is often a prerequisite for resources and services to reach that population – making this form of erasure a remarkably effective anti-trans strategy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although data on trans parents’ needs is still severely lacking globally, the U.K. continues to at least document their existence via the <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/publications/surveys/maternity-survey ">National Maternity Survey</a>, which provides clear evidence that there are people giving birth while trans. In fact, the survey found that between 2021 and 2024, <b>the percentage of birthing parents who reported that their gender was different from the sex they were assigned at birth nearly tripled - from 0.56% to 1.58%.</b> 
                    <span class="tooltip-inline"><i><span uk-icon="icon: info; ratio: 0.6"></span></i>
                        <span class="tooltip-bubble">Another <b>1.62%</b> of birthing parents answered the question about their gender with <b>“I would prefer not to say.”</b> It’s impossible to know why these parents responded this way, but <b>it is possible this 1.62% includes even more non-cisgender parents</b> who just aren’t comfortable reporting their gender identity on a government form.

                    There’s something confusing about this data. The 2021 rate of trans parents giving birth (0.56%) is almost exactly consistent with the general rate of trans people in the British population as of the 2021 census (0.55%) – which makes sense if we assume trans people are as likely to give birth as non-trans people. But the 2024 rate of trans pregnant people is <i>much</i> higher than the 2021 census rate of trans people in the general population, at 1.58%. At face value, that seems to imply that a trans person with a uterus is almost three times more likely than a cisgender woman to have a baby.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But that’s not quite right. According to Dr Ruth Pearce, a sociologist at the University of Glasgow and a major figure in the field of transgender studies, these numbers don’t necessarily mean that trans people have suddenly started having babies at a very high rate. What’s more likely, she suggests, is that trans people with uteruses are having babies at a similar rate to cis women, but a lot more trans people have <i>come out</i> between 2021 and 2024 and are therefore now showing up in data they were invisible in before. If that hypothesis is right, the next census will show that the rate of self-reported trans people in the general population has risen in tandem with the rate of trans people in the birthing population.

                <h2>
                    Shifting demographics
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to the issue of visibility, it is also possible that some of the increase is because trans people actually are more likely to give birth than they were in the past. There are a few logical reasons why that might be the case. For one thing, the (openly) trans population is younger than the general population. Dr Kamilla Kamaruddin, a GP with the East of England Gender Service, says that about 75% of her patients are under 35, and about 60% of them are under 25. Therefore, it makes sense that as that population ages, we’re beginning to see more openly transgender parents.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There’s also the matter of more trans people simply living long enough to become parents. Of Kamaruddin’s approximately 900 patients, 23% report having attempted suicide. “I'm not even talking about suicidal ideation,” she clarifies, “23% have <i>attempted</i> suicide.” All of Kamaruddin’s patients are over 18. Since patients often come to her around that age, she infers that many of these suicide attempts happened when the patients were quite young. She also notes that 33% of them have a history of self-harm.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “And all this stops,” she emphasises, “Self-harm, suicide - all this stops when they're able to transition, when they're able to seek help, when they're able to access therapy from us.” There is plenty of evidence to back up that claim – in general, when more trans people are able to transition, youth suicides drop dramatically. And as more young trans people mature into adulthood, more of them begin to reach the age at which most people start families. Trans people who have had access to the care they need are not only more likely to reach their 20s, 30s, and 40s – they’re also more likely to be in good mental health by the time they get there. And people who aren’t suicidal are more likely to be planning long-term. So, more trans kids growing into happy, stable, fulfilled adults naturally means more trans mummies and daddies (or opies or babas or rennies).

                    One specific challenge many trans people face when it comes to conception is the fact that Hormone Replacement Therapy (or HRT), a common part of many people’s gender affirmation care, reduces fertility. Kamaruddin says that when she warns her patients about this risk, they always ask her ‘by how much?’ She has to tell them the truth: she doesn’t know. “There are no studies to show how many percent fertility is reduced by. So it's not something that I can answer,” she explains. “We just don't have the evidence. It’s a life-saving therapy, but we still don’t know enough.”

                    The lack of information on how HRT impacts fertility is sometimes used as an argument – not for more research – but to condemn trans people who choose to have babies. This argument relies on people conflating the term “reduced fertility” with the idea of harm to a potential future foetus. In fact, “reduced fertility” means exactly that – reduced chances of being able to conceive. The fact that HRT is literally life-saving explains why it is often still the best option, even for people who might want to conceive at some point, despite the fertility risks. It makes sense to prioritise immediate survival over future fertility.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    It is true that HRT cannot be taken during pregnancy, but there is no evidence to suggest <i>having taken it in the past</i> has any negative effect on a foetus. Many, many other common medications also typically need to be stopped during pregnancy, and may be resumed again after the end of breastfeeding – including both long-term prescription medications (antidepressants, anti-seizure medications, etc.) and OTC medications (Ibuprofen, Aspirin, etc.). These decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, between doctor and patient.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Theoretically, patients in the U.K. are entitled to gamete (egg or sperm) storage before starting hormone therapy, to preserve the option of fertility in the future. But waiting lists for this are long – often two or three years, Kamaruddin says. At that point, patients have already been waiting many years for their first appointment at a gender identity clinic, in order to access HRT in the first place. Opting for gamete storage would postpone the start of their treatment for another two to three years <i>on top of that</i>, which isn’t always a feasible option. “So a lot of them decide not to [store gametes] because it's just so long,” she says.

                    Kamaruddin also notes that some trans people are not physically capable of carrying a pregnancy, or find the idea so dysphoric that it is not an option, even if they do want children. And of course, many others are simply not interested in having children at all. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    But she also says that sometimes, even people who didn’t think they were interested in pregnancy do change their mind over time. “They start getting more stable in a job, maybe they're in a stable relationship… so things change.” That’s not really that shocking – as infuriating as it may be to young people to be told they’ll “change their mind” about not wanting children – it does sometimes happen. For many people, trans or otherwise, what they want out of life at, say, age 35 is different from what they wanted out of life at age 18.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Kamaruddin’s role, she says, is to give people as much information as she can, and support them in whatever decision they choose to make. Whether they’re considering going on HRT, or pausing it in order to conceive, she prepares them as much as possible for what might happen if they do.

                <h2>The bottom line</h2>

                <p>
                    Pregnancy and parenting an infant are incredibly challenging, and often incredibly isolating experiences. Breastfeeding support groups like La Leche League and online forums like Mumsnet can provide crucial support through these difficult periods. As in any community, not all pregnant or breastfeeding parents will have all of the same experiences. A trans mum, a cis adoptive mum, and a cis birthing mum might all share an experience with induced lactation, or they might all be struggling with sexist and unrealistic expectations as new mothers. A cis mum and a trans dad might both be dealing with healing complications after giving birth. Some of these experiences <i>are</i> directly related to gender, or to sex assigned at birth. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    But many other challenges new parents face – like sleep deprivation, challenges with latching (whether nipple or bottle), anxieties about their infant’s health, a loss or change in sense of individual identity, financial stress of taking time off of work, sense of isolation that comes with being the primary caregiver of an infant, fears of inadequacy as a parent – can happen to parents of any sex or gender. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first battle, of course, is access to resources and care. But even when trans parents do have access, they still have to navigate medical and community spaces that were not designed for them. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, parent-of-three Nadler says that although the care they received during their first two pregnancies was very good, they also received a lot of gendered messaging that made them very uncomfortable. They share that while at that time they were “pretty closeted”, even to themselves, they were “still very trans”. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “So it was really interesting”, Nadler explains. “I ran into so many situations in which the assumed best care really grated on my sense of self and made me really uncomfortable in ways that I was not even able to explain for myself.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It was this idea that [pregnancy] is beautiful because you're a woman. And tied to some really questionable concepts about the purpose of womanhood” – concepts Nadler neither believed in nor identified with. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, individualised perinatal care absolutely can be empowering for any birthing parent. In the seven years between Nadler’s second birth and their third, they worked as a doula. By the time they were pregnant with their third baby, they had developed much deeper trust in themself and their understanding of the birth process. They also had people around them who they say were not only perinatal professionals, but also happened to know and understand them much more deeply. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result of that, their third experience of pregnancy and birth was very different – no longer tied to ideas of femininity and womanhood that didn’t feel right. “[That] was the year that I came out, and it was through the process of having an extremely supportive perinatal team”, Nadler says. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The process of being supported through [pregnancy] and then having this extremely autonomous birth experience in which I was able to really truly have informed consent over every part of the process - I came out of that with this identity not tied to gender anymore. With this identity of like, <i>oh, I am so powerful</i>, right? Just like, <i>wow, if I can do that, I can do anything</i>”. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For them, that empowerment carried over into other aspects of their life as well. “It's definitely no coincidence that I started coming out within the next few months in a whole number of ways, including around my trans identity.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “That meaning making is a real double-edged sword”, they explain. “It can serve to suppress identity, or given the opportunity, it can serve to be a really powerful identity-bolstering experience.” Nadler also explains that the type of birthing experience someone has affects their mental health long after the baby is born. “It's so impactful,” they say. “The link between more empowered birthing experiences and lower rates of postpartum depression and postpartum anxiety is really strong.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    And that matters for baby too. A large and growing body of evidence suggests that the health of a birthing parent and their infant are incredibly intertwined, in ways medicine is only beginning to understand. They have synchronised Circadian rhythms and heart rates. Their sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are interconnected. Parent and baby sleeping beside one other move in sync throughout the night, unconsciously following one another like sunflowers following the sun. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    And while some aspects of this connection may be specific to the birthing parent, many others are not. Research also demonstrates psychological synchrony between caregivers and their infants regardless of the caregiver’s gender, or whether the child was adopted or not. An infant’s bond with their birthing parent matters, but bonds with other loving adults can also be crucially important. In many ways, all parents, cis or trans, need the same thing - attentive and compassionate perinatal care, mentally as well as physically. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Healthcare access is a big part of British identity. Survey data has shown again and again that <a href=" https://www.health.org.uk/press-office/press-releases/nhs-remains-our-biggest-source-of-national-pride-but-public-are-worried"> the NHS is Brits’ greatest source of national pride</a>. That value extends to reproductive healthcare as well. While the debate over abortion rages on in the U.S., an overwhelming <a href=" https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/47568-where-does-the-british-public-stand-on-abortion-in-2023">87% of British people support abortion rights</a>, compared to only 6% who do not. Brits don’t take kindly to U.S. interference in this matter, either. When in April the Trump administration attempted to interfere in British law protecting abortion clinics, it triggered outrage from many Britons, who saw the interference as a violation of both national sovereignty and bodily autonomy.

                    Mainstream British feminism may not yet see trans parents’ access to perinatal care and support as also being a fundamental reproductive rights issue. But <a href="https://www.birthcompanions.org.uk/pages/reproductive-justice">Birth Companions</a>, a charity which has been working to support the perinatal health of the most marginalised in the U.K. for over 25 years, cites <a href="https://www.sistersong.net/reproductive-justice">Sister Song’s philosophy of reproductive justice</a> as central to their values – a definition which encompasses “the right to have children” and “the right to parent the children we have in safe and sustainable communities” in addition to “the right to maintain personal bodily autonomy” and “the right to not have children”. And despite a couple of noisy resignations, La Leche League Great Britain has not budged on last year’s decision to be more inclusive of trans parents.

                    Finally, doctors like Kamaruddin and activists like Pearce continue to advocate for the community on a daily basis, spreading a vision for a different kind of feminist ideology, which they hope will take root in the U.K..
