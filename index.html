                <h2>Firestorm</h2>
                
                <p>
                    The media coverage of transgender people in the U.K. (a.k.a. TERF Island) is, in general, pretty bizarre – offering seemingly endless sympathetic attention to the anti-trans rights movement (which prefers to refer to itself as “gender critical”). It becomes increasingly bizarre in the context of anything related to reproduction or babies, topics which have unfortunately become a hotbed of transphobia in recent years.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For example – last October, international breastfeeding charity La Leche League (LLL), after an entire year of deliberation, decided to yield to member-led activism for more inclusive support group policies. Any breastfeeding parent seeking to join one of their breastfeeding support groups would now be able to, regardless of the parent’s gender. Marian Tompson, 95, one of La Leche League’s seven original founding members, resigned in protest. One trustee of the Great British chapter of the organisation followed suit.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This triggered a months-long a firestorm of articles, in every major publication in the nation, pontificating at nauseum on the moral implications of what seemed somewhat like routine organisational growing pains. All established charities experience tensions between the interests of the old guard leadership (trustees, board members, and founders), which tend to be more conservative, and the evolving needs of the actual population currently being served. Not all of these disagreements strike a political nerve enough to occupy headlines for weeks on end. Moreover, this incident wasn’t unique – it was only one wave of years of very public debate over whether trans parents should be allowed to seek help from breastfeeding support groups.

                <h2>Caught in the middle</h2>

                <p>
                    In the midst of the fireworks, trans parents don’t have any choice but to navigate these spaces to get what they need for themselves and their babies (new or on-the-way). 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sadly, “queer and trans people” and “families with kids” are often framed as mutually exclusive groups. Of course, queer and trans people do also form alternative kinship networks. But despite Anita Bryant’s infamous argument that they cannot “reproduce themselves,” and must “recruit” to survive, queer and trans people do not spontaneously regenerate themselves, nor do they recruit humans to undergo an alchemical change of species. Instead, they are born, and grow into children, and adults, much as other humans are. As such, like other humans, many of them feel there is meaning in continuing the human life cycle by taking on the tedious and wonderful work of parenting. For some, adoption may be the best option, but for others, pregnancy is. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    “I wanted children very much,” says Dr. Audacity Nadler, who themself has given birth three times. “I was not at all tied to the idea of growing them myself. It's just, like, how else am I gonna get them here, right?” they say with a laugh.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although research on trans parents’ needs is severely lacking, we do have clear evidence that they exist. In fact, the National Maternity Survey found that between 2021 and 2024, the percentage of birthing parents who reported that their gender was different from the sex they were assigned at birth nearly tripled - from 0.56% to 1.58%.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There’s something confusing about this data. The 2021 rate of trans parents giving birth (0.56%) is almost exactly consistent with the general rate of trans people in the population as of the 2021 census (0.55%) – which makes sense if we assume trans people are as likely to give birth as non-trans people. But the 2024 rate of trans pregnant people is much higher than the 2021 census rate of trans people in the general population, at 1.58%. At face value, that seems to imply that a trans person with a uterus is almost three times more likely than a cisgender woman to have a baby.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But that’s not quite right. According to Dr Ruth Pearce, a sociologist at the University of Glasgow and major figure in the field of transgender studies, these numbers don’t necessarily mean that trans people have suddenly started having babies at a very high rate. What’s more likely, she suggests, is that trans people with uteruses are having babies at a similar rate to ciswomen, but a lot more trans people have come out between 2021 and 2024 and are therefore now showing up in data they were invisible in before. If she’s right, the next census will show that the rate of self-reported trans people in the general population has risen in tandem with the rate of trans people in the birthing population.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is essential that surveys continue to ask questions about gender identity. In a system that prioritises “evidence-based” policies and programmes, data on the existence of a population is a prerequisite for resources and services for that population. Therefore, erasing people from the data is a remarkably effective long-term subjugation strategy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This strategy is being used deliberately and on a huge scale in the United States, which in February modified all federal forms to only include the options “male,” “female,” or “missing data.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    It was part of researcher and evaluator Dr Audacity Nadler’s job to inform home visiting programmes, which support new parents and infants, that they needed to stop collecting any other data on gender. “There was just starting to be progress in delving into the fact that our community of transgender parents and caregivers, and transgender people giving birth, even exists,” says Nadler, who is also a former doula and a parent of three. “There was just a tiny inroad into having knowledge about that community at all. And now that's been cut off in so many ways and erased again. So it feels like the personal stories are all we have for information about our community's needs.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to the issue of visibility, it is also possible that some of the increase is because trans people actually are more likely to give birth than they were in the past. It’s only one theory, but there are a few logical reasons it might be the case.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For one thing, the trans population is younger than the general population. Dr Kamilla Kamaruddin, a GP with the East of England Gender Service, says that about 75% of her patients are under 35, and about 60% of them are under 25. Therefore, it makes sense that as that population ages, we’re beginning to see more openly transgender parents.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There’s also the matter of more trans people simply living long enough to become parents. Of Kamaruddin’s approximately 900 patients, 23% report having attempted suicide. “I'm not even talking about suicidal ideation,” she clarifies, “23% have attempted suicide.” All of Kamaruddin’s patients are over 18. Since patients often come to her around that age, she infers that many of these suicide attempts happened when the patients were quite young. She also notes that 33% of them have a history of self-harm.
                </p>

                <p>
                “And all this stops,” she emphasises, “Self-harm, suicide - all this stops when they're able to transition, when they're able to seek help, when they're able to access therapy from us.” There is plenty of evidence to back up that claim – in general, when more trans people are able to transition, youth suicides drop dramatically. And as more young trans people mature into adulthood, more of them begin to reach the age at which most people start families. Trans people who have had access to the care they need are not only more likely to reach their 20s, 30s, and 40s – they’re also more likely to be in good mental health by the time they get there. And people who aren’t suicidal are more likely to be planning long-term. So, more trans kids growing into happy, stable, fulfilled adults naturally means more trans mummies and daddies (and opies and babas and…).

                <h2>The catch</h2>
                
                <p>
                    However, there’s a massive caveat: Hormone Replacement Therapy (or HRT), a common part of many people’s gender affirmation care, reduces fertility. Kamaruddin says that when she warns her patients about this risk, they always ask her ‘by how much?’ She has to tell them the truth: she doesn’t know. “There are no studies to show how many percent fertility is reduced by. So it's not something that I can answer,” she explains. “We just don't have the evidence. It’s a life-saving therapy, but we still don’t know enough.”
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Unfortunately this is sometimes used as an argument – not for more research – but to condemn trans people who choose to have babies. This argument relies on people conflating the term “reduced fertility” with the idea of harm to a potential future foetus. In fact, “reduced fertility” means exactly that – reduced chances of being able to conceive. The fact that HRT is literally life-saving explains why it is often still the best option, even for people who might want to conceive at some point, despite the fertility risks. It makes sense to prioritise immediate survival over future fertility.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    It is true that HRT cannot be taken during pregnancy, but there is no evidence to suggest having taken it in the past has any negative effect on a foetus. Many, many other common medications also typically need to be stopped during pregnancy, and may be resumed again after the end of breastfeeding – including both long-term prescription medications (antidepressants, anti-seizure medications, etc.) and OTC medications (Ibuprofen, Aspirin, etc.). These decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, between doctor and patient.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Theoretically, patients in the U.K. are entitled to gamete (egg or sperm) storage before starting hormone therapy, to preserve the option of fertility in the future. But waiting lists for this are long – often two or three years, Kamaruddin says. At that point, patients have already been waiting many years to access HRT at all, and postponing an indefinite length of time isn’t always a feasible option. “So a lot of them decide not to [store gametes] because it's just so long,” she says. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Kamaruddin also notes that some trans people are not physically capable of carrying a pregnancy, or find the idea so dysphoric that it is not an option, even if they do want children. And of course, many others are simply not interested in having children at all. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    But she also says that sometimes, even people who didn’t think they were interested in pregnancy do change their mind over time. “They start getting more stable in a job, maybe they're in a stable relationship… so things change.” That’s not really that shocking – as infuriating as it may be to young people to be told they’ll “change their mind” about not wanting children – it does sometimes happen. For many people, trans or otherwise, what they want out of life at, say, age 35 is different than what they wanted out of life at age 18.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Kamaruddin’s role, she says, is to give people as much information as she can, and support them in whatever decision they choose to make. Whether they’re considering going on HRT, or pausing it in order to conceive, she prepares them as much as possible for what might happen if they do.

                <h2>The bottom line</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Regardless of how families form, perinatal supports matter!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Pregnancy and parenting an infant are incredibly challenging, and often incredibly isolating experiences. Emotional support for parents is crucial during this period. A breastfeeding support group exists, after all, not only because of all the issues that can arise around latching and sufficient milk production - but also because of how socially and psychologically important breastfeeding is to many parents.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is true that some challenges new parents might want to talk about are specific to birthing parents (including some trans parents) – like healing and urinary incontinence. Others are specific to parents who identify as women and mothers (including some trans moms) – like sexist social pressures related to the unrealistic expectations. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    But many other challenges new parents face – like sleep deprivation, challenges with latching (whether nipple or bottle), anxieties about their infant’s health, a loss or change in sense of individual identity, financial stress of taking time off of work, sense of isolation that comes with being the primary caregiver of an infant, fears of inadequacy as a parent – are all equal-opportunity to parents of any sex or gender. On top of all of that, trans parents may also experience unique breastfeeding challenges that cis mothers do not. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first battle, of course, is access to these spaces and resources. But even when receiving high-quality perinatal care, the experience can be challenging for trans parents due to the language used. Nadler, for example, says that during their first two pregnancies and deliveries, “I was pretty closeted, even to myself, but I was still very trans. So it was really interesting. I ran into so many situations in which the assumed best care really grated on my sense of self and made me really uncomfortable in ways that I was not even able to explain for myself.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    They say that even though the perinatal care they received was very good, “it was still framed from this very, like, woman-centric feminist perspective that was really tied to finding meaning in the experience tied to a female identity. And that was so far from my experience that I was having that I was not even able to articulate at the time. A lot of the rhetoric around how meaningful it is to give life and how beautiful it is to use one's body for creating another human being was so uncomfortable for me that I was constantly running into this, like, oh, this feels bad, but I don't know why. And I can't explain why. And nobody's questioning that it should feel anything other than good. And so that was really the way that my identity clashed with the care that I received. It was this idea that it's beautiful because you're a woman. And tied to some really questionable concepts about the purpose of womanhood.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the other hand, individualised perinatal care absolutely can be empowering for any birthing parent. In the seven years between Nadler’s second birth and their third, they worked as a doula. Working in this field naturally created around them an “environment of people who not only were professionals in perinatal fields, but also knew me personally really well and understood who I was a lot more deeply.” These people were able to show up for Nadler as they needed, and help create a birth experience that was not tied to womanhood. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    It was, however, connected to meaning making and identity exploration. “The year that I gave birth [to my third child] was the year that I came out, and it was through the process of having an extremely supportive perinatal team,” Nadler says. “The process of being supported through [pregnancy] and then having this extremely autonomous birth experience in which I was able to really truly have informed consent over every part of the process - I came out of that with this identity not tied to gender anymore. With this identity of like, oh, I am so powerful, right? Just like, wow, if I can do that, I can do anything.” 
                </p>

                <p>
                    For Nadler, this carried over into other aspects of their life. “It's definitely no coincidence that I started coming out within the next few months in a whole number of ways, including around my trans identity… That meaning making is a real double-edged sword,” they explain. “It can serve to suppress identity, or given the opportunity, it can serve to be a really powerful identity-bolstering experience.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nadler also explains that the type of birthing experience someone has affects their mental health long after the baby is born. “It's so impactful,” they say. “The link between more empowered birthing experiences and lower rates of postpartum depression and postpartum anxiety is really strong.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    And that matters for baby too. A  large and growing body of evidence suggests that the health of a birthing parent and their infant are incredibly intertwined, in ways medicine is only beginning to understand. They have synchronised Circadian rhythms and heart rates. Their sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are interconnected. Parent and baby sleeping beside one other move in sync throughout the night, unconsciously following one another like sunflowers following the sun. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    And while some aspects of this connection may be specific to the birthing parent, many others are not. Research also demonstrates psychological synchrony between caregivers and their infants regardless of the caregiver’s gender, or whether the child was adopted or not. An infant’s bond with their birthing parent matters, but bonds with other loving adults can also be crucially important. In many ways, all parents, cis or trans, need the same thing - attentive and compassionate perinatal care, mentally as well as physically.
